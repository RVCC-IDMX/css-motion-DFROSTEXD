      <!-- Caption explaining the motion's personality -->
      <p class="motion-caption">
        I wanted to make the motion of the button not too dramatic. When viewing the HAP website, it showed a button expanding by 1.2%, it looked like it expands too much, so I kept it at 1.1% to let users know they are hovering over it without too much of a dramatic change.

      <!-- Explanation of timing differences -->
      <p class="motion-caption">
        For the first one, I went with a more gradual transition, looks smooth and natural. The second one jumps out at you, makes it more exciting and grabs your attention. To me, I like the first one because it feels more natural and not super jumpy.

        <h3>Reduced Motion Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          For the most part I disabled the animations because while I believe that the animations are important, someones motion sickness should not be overlooked. So disabling them makes it so that people who want to look at the site can still do so without having to worry about motion sickness.

      <!-- Personal reflection -->
      <div class="reflection-text">
        <h3>Design Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          What surprised me was just how versitile animations are in web design. Before I saw the Kevin Powell video, I assumed animations were for very small interactions, like what was made in the micro interactions section. However, with just how much went into the card flip animation, I see just how many different ways we can animate elements. Moreover I see the potential with animations to make a site more engaging and fun to use for the user.
